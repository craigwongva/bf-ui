   - proposed shoreline data
1. Edit the proposed shoreline data

## Why: [justification]

## Evaluation of current capability
This can be done in a number of GIS applications. 
We would need for our GIS analysts to try out this operation and produce TTPs (tools, techniques, and procedures).
It is possible that we would be able to provide to streamline the TTPs over time.
