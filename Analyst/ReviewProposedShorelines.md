# Review Proposed Shorelines

## Who: Analyst

## What: Review and edit proposed shoreline vector data
Display proposed shoreline vector data in an appropriate map view with the following layers:
- imagery basemap
- image used to collect shoreline vectors
- baseline shoreline data
- proposed shoreline data

## Why: [justification]

## Evaluation of current capability
This can be done in a number of GIS applications. 
We would need for our GIS analysts to try out this operation and produce TTPs (tools, techniques, and procedures).
It is possible that we would be able to provide to streamline the TTPs over time.
